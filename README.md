While studying computer science I created a planning tool named Project Planner for Unity and sold it on the Asset Store. Now that I am done studying and getting a job I have decided to release it for free. I have removed some features that required me to have servers running and some that was never used by anyone.

I don't plan to actively work on it anymore, but still feel free to contact me or create an issue if you have questions or suggestions. Hope you find it useful for planning your next game in Unity or just learning from it.

<!-- How to install -->
# How to install
Before installing Project Planner, make sure asset serialization mode is set to “Force Text”. You can find the setting here “Edit->Project Settings->Editor->Asset Serialization”.

To install Project Planner you can either download the entire project from GitHub and copy the Project Planner root folder into your own Assets folder. You can also (recommended) download the [`Project Planner 1.5.unitypackage`](https://github.com/LeviMooreDev/Project-Planner/blob/master/Project%20Planner%201.5.unitypackage) file and import that into your unity project.

# Manual
You can find a manual under [`Assets->Project Planner->Manual.pdf`](https://github.com/LeviMooreDev/Project-Planner/blob/master/Assets/Project%20Planner/Manual.pdf). I have tried to be very thorough with it so be sure to check it out first if you have a question.

<!-- Store Description -->
# Original Store Description
Do you sometimes feel it is difficult to keep track of what you need to do and in what order? If yes, Project Planner is a great tool that can help you!

Project Planner speeds up your game development by helping you organize your work into boards, groups, and tasks right inside the editor. With an intuitive and easy to use interface Project Planner feels like a natural part of the editor; you may even forget that it does not come with Unity by default.

By doing project management inside of Unity, you can take advantage of unique features like assigning assets to a task. This is an excellent way of keeping track of the assets needed when working on a specific task. You can see how this works in our video here.

⇩ HIGHLIGHTS ⇩

<strong>• Never Leave the Editor</strong><br>
By doing project management inside of Unity, you avoid getting distracted by non-work related things.

<strong>• Assign Assets to Specific Tasks</strong><br>
With Project Planner, you can assign assets from your project to specific tasks. This makes assets easy to find again later.

<strong>• Nested Subtasks</strong><br>
Split big tasks into smaller subtasks. There is no limit on nested tasks, so you have full control over how deep you want to go.

<strong>• Add Tasks from Anywhere</strong><br>
You don't have to stop working when you get a good idea anymore. Use the quick task window from anywhere.

<strong>• Organize with Tags and Colors</strong><br>
Filter what to show with tags and colors. Colors are a great way of identifying the kind of task you are looking at quickly.

<strong>• Great for Agile Game Development</strong><br>
It is easy to use an agile system like Scrum in Project Planner. You can quickly set up things like task boards and sprints.

<strong>• Highly Customizable</strong><br>
One of our goals is to make Project Planner as customizable as possible, so everyone can make it look and behave the way they want.

<strong>• Does Not Affect Your Game</strong><br>
Project Planner comes precompiled which means that it does not affect your compile time or game performance.

<strong>• Learn with Demo Content</strong><br>
You can import demo content that is designed to guide you through the primary features and how to use them.

<strong>• Fully Documented</strong><br>
Everything is fully documented and easy to understand. We are also going to make small video tutorials in the future.
